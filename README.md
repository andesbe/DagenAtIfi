The purpose of this coding challenge is to count the number of vowels in a string (data.txt). 

The coding challenge itself should be done in the challenge.ipynb notebook. In the name of expediency, the txt file has already been loaded and converted to a string. 

In order to start, the startup.py should be run from the terminal, and the correct number of vowels be typed into the terminal prompt.
