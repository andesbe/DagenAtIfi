# Dagen@ifi

The purpose of this coding challenge is to count the number of vowels in a string (data.txt). 

The coding challenge itself should be done in the challenge.ipynb notebook. In the name of expediency, the txt file has already been loaded and converted to a string. 

In order to start, the start.py should be run from the terminal, and the correct number of vowels be typed into the terminal prompt. 


### Prerequisites

Remember to run 

:set autoread

in vim for the leaderboard txt file. This is to ensure that it updates when the startup.py script pushes changes.

Alternatively, you could run the scripting_print.py file in a terminal. 



### TODO

Set the vim window to autoupdate even without clicking on the window itself.
